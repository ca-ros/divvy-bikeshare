## Introduction

Take an old bicycle. Paint it white. Leave it anywhere in the city. Tell people to use it. This was the first urban bike-sharing concept in history. Launched in Amsterdam in the 1960s, it was called the Witte Fietsenplan (the “white bicycle plan”). And it was not a great success.

Here, we will identify the following:
- Which stations are the most popular?
- What are the peak hours of bike usage?
- How do holidays and events affect bike usage?
- What is the possible purpose of rentals? Casual and Subscriber?
- How do station's popularity goes over time?
