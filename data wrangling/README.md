<h2 align = "center">Setting up SQL Environment</h2>

The SQL database that I used in this analysis is [PostgreSQL](https://www.postgresql.org) and I used [pgAdmin 4](https://www.pgadmin.org/download/) as the database tool.

*PgAdmin 4* has a default schema named "Public", it can be seen under Servers > PostgreSQL 14 > Databases > postgres > Schemas > Public.

We need to create another schema named "bike_trips" to compile all our files under it, instead in "public" schema. Follow the steps:

1. *Right click* "Schemas".
2. *Click* "Create".
3. *Click* "Schema".
4. On **Name**, enter "bike_trips".
5. *Click* "Save".

Lastly, to open the **Query Tool** press *ALT + SHIFT + Q*, or click the Query tool icon on the upper-left corner of pgAdmin.

&nbsp;

<h2 align = "center">Combining data</h2>

The process of combining all the data into one table as a yearly data and using the **File Naming Convention (FNC)**.

Steps:

1. Download all the data for year 2013 to 2021 [here](https://divvy-tripdata.s3.amazonaws.com/index.html).
2. Download the stations data [here](https://data.cityofchicago.org/api/views/bbyy-e7gq/rows.csv?accessType=DOWNLOAD), this data is from [Chicago Data Portal](https://data.cityofchicago.org/). For this analysis, I will refer to the table as **Stations table**.
3. After extracting the zip files, compile separately all the yearly bike-trips data and the stations data included in that folder. Name the folder as the year it represents.
4. Start compiling the data.
5. For file naming convention, all combined trip-data must named by "year" followed by "-divvy-tripdata.csv"

*Using RStudio*
```r
# load the necessary library

install.library(tidyverse)
library(tidyverse)
```

Upon checking the structure of the tables in each year, we can notice that 2013-2019 have same data structure, while 2020-2021 have a different type of structure.

Since the type of data from year 2020-2021 is different; where the station_ids are varchar instead of bigint and tables have an additional columns for stations' latitude and longitude, we will compile the two range of years separately.

Combine all the trips from year 2020-2021, and do the same for year 2020-2021.

> I named the year 2013-2019 table as trips_p1, and 2020-2021 table as trips_p2.

<h2 align = "center">Trips table</h2>

The process of cleaning station names and station IDs in trips table, by verifying and matching the data available in Google Maps and Stations table.

We need to import the **Stations** table to serve as a reference for our cleaning proces. But, before importing the file we need to make some changes:

Steps:
1. **Open Excel**: *Under Data* > *Get & Transform Data* > *Get Data* > *From File* > *From Text/CSV* > locate and import [Divvy_Bicycle_Stations.csv](). Under *Data Type Detection* select *Do not detect data types* and click **Load**. Delete **Sheet1**.
2. **Remove row1**: Under *Table Design* > *Tools* > click *Convert to Range*, select **OK**. Then delete row1 which contains column#.
3. **Freeze the header row/ top row**: Under *View* > *Window* > *Freeze Panes* > *Freeze Top Row*.
4. **Delete duplicate stations**: Use conditional formatting on ColumnB (Station Name) to easily identify duplicate values. Under *Home* > *Styles* > *Conditional Formatting* > *Highlight Cell Rules* > *Duplicate Values*.
5. Sort sheet by **Station Name** and look for duplicate values. Delete the record which has larger station ID. Then proceed to the next process.
6. By using **Find and Replace**, remove all the parenthesis on **coordinates** column. Find "(" or ")" then leave the *Replace with* field as blank. Do it for both open and close parenthesis.
7. **Remove column**: **Docks in Service**
8. Change the values under **Status** column: Not in Service = No, In Service = Yes.
9. **Rename columns**: Station Name = **name**, Total Docks = **docks**, Status = **in_service**, and Location = **coordinate**.
12. Save as [Stations.csv]().

*Import csv file*

```sql
-- Create table
CREATE TABLE bike_trips.stations (
  id bigint,
  name varchar,
  docks int,
  in_service text,
  latitude numeric,
  longitude numeric,
  coordinate point);
```

```sql
-- Import csv file
COPY bike_trips.stations (
  id,
  name,
  docks,
  in_service,
  latitude,
  longitude,
  coordinate)
FROM 'D:/Github/divvy-bikeshare/csv files/stations/Stations.csv'
DELIMITER ',' CSV HEADER;
```

> P.S. You can open normally the csv file using Excel but it will mess-up the station IDs.

  FROM bike_trips.stations as s
  WHERE s.name = t.name);

-- 163 records
```

Export the result as [trips_p1_stations.csv]().

In order to analyze the table, the following is done.

<h4><strong>Process</strong>:</h4>

1. Open the csv file using MS Excel. Rename columns: **id = old_id** & **name = old_name**.
2. Create a new header for column C: **new_id**, column D: **new_name**, and column E: **changes**.
3. **Import the Stations table**: Under *Data* > *Get & Transform Data* > *Get Data* > *From File* > *From Text/CSV* > locate [Stations.csv](). Under *Data Type Detection*, select *Do not detect data types* and click **Load**.
4. **Remove row1**: Under *Table Design* > *Tools* > click **Convert to Range**, select **OK**. Then delete row1 which contains column#.
5. Copy column **id** to the right of column **name**. *Right Click* column C and select Insert, a new empty column C should appear. Copy ColumnA to ColumnC.
6. **Freeze the header row/ top row**: Under *View* > *Window* > *Freeze Panes* > *Freeze Top Row*. Do the same for the other sheet.
7. In **trips_p1_stations** sheet:

   - **Cell C2**: enter the formula `=IFNA(VLOOKUP(TEXT(B2,0),Stations!$B:$D,2,FALSE),"same")`, then press Enter. Click the cell again and double-click the *bottom-right* corner of the cell to copy the formula in the entire row.
   - **Cell D2**: enter the formula `=IFNA(VLOOKUP(TEXT(A2,0),Stations!$A:$B,2,FALSE),"same")`, then press Enter. Click the cell again and double-click the *bottom-right* corner of the cell to copy the formula in the entire row.
   - **Cell E2**: enter the formula `=IF(AND(D2="same",C2="same"),"missing",IF(B2=D2,"same",IF(AND(A2<>C2,D2="same"),"id",IF(B2<>D2,"name"))))`, then press Enter. Click the cell again and double-click the *bottom-right* corner of the cell to copy the formula in the entire row.
   
8. **Use conditinal formatting**: Under *Home* > *Styles* > *Conditional Formatting* > *Highlight Cell Rules* > ...

    - **Column C**: *Text that contains* > "*same*" with **Green Fill with Dark Green Text**.
    - **Column D**: *Text that contains* > "*same*" with **Green Fill with Dark Green Text**.
    - **Column E**: 
      - *Text that contains* > "*missing*" with **Light Red Fill with Dark Red Text**.
      - *Text that contains* > "*name*" with **Yellow Fill with Dark Yellow Text**.
      - *Text that contains* > "*id*" with **Green Fill with Dark Green Text**.
      
9. Validate the **new_name** column by searching each names in [Google Maps](https://www.google.com/maps) and locate nearby **divvy-stations**.

    - **Example**:

      <details><summary>Click Me!</summary>
      <p>

      ID = **17**, name = **Wood St & Division St**. Use [Google Maps](https://www.google.com/maps) to validate the station_name.

      - Search Chicago to focus the search in Chicago City.

      ![Chicago](https://snipboard.io/vYIsW9.jpg)

      - Enter the station_name, **Wood St & Division St**, and *press Enter*.
      - Click **Nearby** and search **divvy**, to search nearby divvy-bike stations.

      ![17](https://snipboard.io/n4qvdG.jpg)

      - Hover over to the nearest station to view the station name.

      ![17.2](https://snipboard.io/LHBqnm.jpg)

      The nearest station is **Honore St & Division St**.

      > Upon checking the **Stations** table on ID number 17, we can confirm that station_id 17 is Honore St & Division St.

      ![17 excel](https://snipboard.io/najrpI.jpg)

      > Thus, **Wood St & Division St** is a wrong station name and must be replaced with correct name **Honore St & Division St**. You can also notice under **changes** column, it says **name**, which means **name change**.

      ![sample excel](https://snipboard.io/ixN0TV.jpg)

      </p>
      </details>

` `  

10. **Create another table**: 

    - For **missing stations**: (24 records)
      - Filter changes column with values **missing**. Copy columns **old_id** and **old_name** into a new blank workbook and save it as [missing_stations_p1.csv]().
    - For **id changes**: (2 records)
      - Filter changes column with values **id**. Copy columns **old_name** and **new_id** into a new blank workbook and save it as [id_changes_p1.csv]().
    - For **name changes**: (137 records)
      - Filter changes column with values **name**. Copy columns **old_name** and **new_name** into a new blank workbook and save it as [name_changes_p1.csv]().

> **Optional**: You can hide error values indicators. Under *File* > *Options* > *Formulas* > *Error Checking* > uncheck *Enable background error checking*.

> Upon checking, 2 station names from **trips_p1** table has already existing names in **Stations** table. Thus, duplicate station names with a different **station_id**.

` `  

Going back to PostgreSQL:

Stations names **Lakefront Trail & Bryn Mawr Ave** and **Michigan Ave & 71st St** already have existing IDs in **Stations** table.

Since the smaller station ID is not used in **Stations** table, I used it as a new station ID which are **459** and **651** for **Lakefront Trail & Bryn Mawr Ave** and **Michigan Ave & 71st St** respectively.

**SQL Queries:**

*Import csv file*

- id_changes_p1.csv

```
Export the result as [trips_p2_stations.csv](https://github.com/56i8/divvy-bikeshare/blob/master/csv%20files/stations/trips_p2_stations.csv). 

**Process:**

1. Open the csv file using MS Excel. Rename columns: **id = old_id** & **name = old_name**.
2. Create a new header for column C: **new_id**, column D: **new_name** and column E: **changes**, and column F: **verified**.
3. **Import the Stations table**: Under *Data* > *Get & Transform Data* > *Get Data* > *From File* > *From Text/CSV* > locate [Stations.csv](). Under *Data Type Detection* > select *Do not detect data types* and click **Load**.
4. **Remove row1**: Under *Table Design* > *Tools* > click **Convert to Range**, select **OK**. Then delete row1 which contains column#.
5. Copy column **id** to the right of column **name**. *Right Click* column C and select Insert, a new empty column C should appear. Copy ColumnA to ColumnC.
6. **Freeze the header row/ top row**: Under *View* > *Window* > *Freeze Panes* > *Freeze Top Row*. Do the same for the other sheet.
7. In **trips_p2_stations** sheet:

    - **Cell C2**: enter the formula `=IFNA(VLOOKUP(TEXT(B2,0),Stations!$B:$D,2,FALSE),"same")`, then press Enter. Click the cell again and double-click the bottom-right corner of the cell to copy the formula in the entire row.

Click cell E2 again and double-click the bottom-right corner of the cell to copy the formula in the entire row.

8. **Use conditinal formatting**: Under *Home* > *Styles* > *Conditional Formatting* > *Highlight Cell Rules* > ...

    - **Column A**: *Duplicate Values*.
    - **Column B**: *Duplicate Values*.
    - **Column C**: *Text that contains* > "*same*" with **Green Fill with Dark Green Text**.

    - **Column F**: *Text that contains* > "*y*" with **Green Fill with Dark Green Text**.
9. Validate the **new_name** column by searching each names in [Google Maps](https://www.google.com/maps) and locate nearby **divvy-stations**.

    <details><summary>Validating sample:</summary>
    <p>

    - station_id = 17
    - Either a missing station_id **17** or station_name **Wood St & Division St**.

    Using [Google Maps](https://www.google.com/maps) to validate the station_name.

    - Search **Chicago** to focus the search in Chicago City.

    ![Chicago](https://snipboard.io/vYIsW9.jpg)

    - Enter the station_name, **Wood St & Division St**, and *press Enter*.
    - Click **Nearby** and search **divvy**, to search nearby divvy-bike stations.

    ![17](https://snipboard.io/n4qvdG.jpg)

    - Hover over to the nearest station to view the station name.

    ![17.2](https://snipboard.io/LHBqnm.jpg)

    The nearest station is **Honore St & Division St**.

    > Upon checking the **Stations** table on ID number 17, we can confirm that station_id 17 is Honore St & Division St.

    ![17 excel](https://snipboard.io/najrpI.jpg)

    > Thus, **Wood St & Division St** is a wrong station name and must be replaced with correct name **Honore St & Division St**. You can also notice under **changes** column, it says **name**, which means **name change**.

    ![sample excel](https://snipboard.io/ixN0TV.jpg)

    </p></details>

` `  

10. **Cleaning process**: aside from `VLOOKUP`, we will use **Find**, **Google Maps**, and manual process to match the data.

    - **Example #1**: *Find*
      1. Filter changes column by **missing** and sort the sheet by **old_name** in ascending order.
      2. First row of **old_name** column is **Archer (Damen) Ave & 37th St** with ID = **18022**. Then, *Find* **Archer** in **Stations** sheet and click *Find all*.
      3. Among the results, we can find **Archer Damen Ave & 37th St** with ID = **645**.
      4. Go back to **trips_p2_stations** sheet. Replace the values in columns **new_id** and **new_name** with **645** and **Archer Damen Ave & 37th St** respectively.
      5. Notice than value in **changes** column changed from **missing** to **both**, which means that data needs to change its **name** and **id**.
      6. Put "**y**" in the **verified** column.

    - **Example #2**: *Google Maps*
      1. Filter changes column by **missing** and sort the sheet by **old_name** in ascending order.
      2. Second row of **old_name** column is **Base - 2132 W Hubbard Warehouse** with ID = **Hubbard Bike-checking (LBS-WH-TEST)**. The station_id is **varchar** data type, so we need to confirm the station name. If you remember, in **missing_stations_p1.csv** there is a missing station that contains **Hubbard**.
      3. Upon checking we can see ID = **671** and name = **HUBBARD ST BIKE CHECKING (LBS-WH-TEST)**. We should check if these two stations are the same by checking out its coordinate and locate it on **Google Maps**.
      4. **Run a query**:
          - Base - 2132 W Hubbard Warehouse
          ```sql
          SELECT start_lat, start_lng FROM bike_trips.trips_p2
          WHERE start_station_name = 'Base - 2132 W Hubbard Warehouse'

          /*
          start_lat = 41.8899545160741
          start_lng = -87.6806509494781
          coordinate = 41.8899545160741, -87.6806509494781
          */
          ```

          - HUBBARD ST BIKE CHECKING (LBS-WH-TEST)
          ```sql
          SELECT start_lat, start_lng FROM bike_trips.trips_p2
          WHERE start_station_name = 'HUBBARD ST BIKE CHECKING (LBS-WH-TEST)'

          /*
          start_lat = 41.89
          start_lng = -87.6807
          coordinate = 41.89, -87.6807
          */
          ```

      5. **Locate** both coordinates in Google Maps. 

      ![coordinate](https://snipboard.io/oHMIyk.jpg)

      6. Both coordinates point at **Divvy Service Warehouse**. Therefore, change the name of both stations to **Divvy Service Warehouse** and use ID = **671**.
      7. Put "**y**" in the **verified** column. 

    - **Example #3**: *Manual process*
      1. Sort sheet by column **id** in ascending order and look for duplicate values.
      2. On ID = **329**, we can see different records. One record has changes to **name** and the other has changes to **both**.

      ![329](https://snipboard.io/4ZGcKj.jpg)

      3. The station name **Central Park Ave & Douglas Blvd** is actually on the **Stations** table, its just the ID used in the **trips** table is different which creates a conflict with on station IDs. Therefore, we can change the value in **new_name** column by **same**.

      ![329 cleaned](https://snipboard.io/AqMiYN.jpg)

      4. Put "**y**" in the **verified** column.

     
11. **Create another table**: 

    - For **missing stations**:
      - Filter changes column with values **missing**. Copy columns **old_id**, **old_name**, and **new_id** into a new blank workbook. Remove row14 where **old_id** and **old_name** is equal to **NULL**. Remove all values in **old_id** column except if it has a "**same**" value on **new_id** column. Delete **new_id** column and save it as [missing_stations_p2.csv]().
    - For **id changes**:
      - Filter changes column with values **id** and **both**. Copy columns **old_name** and **new_id** into a new blank workbook. Remove duplicates on **old_name** column and remove rows where values on **old_name** column = **NULL**. Save it as [id_changes_p2.csv]().
    - For **name changes**:
      - Filter changes column with values **name** and **both**. Copy columns **old_name** and **new_name** into a new blank workbook. Remove duplicates on **old_name** column and remove rows where values on **old_name** column = **NULL**. Save it as [name_changes_p2.csv]().


> **Optional**: You can hide error values indicators. Under *File* > *Options* > *Formulas* > *Error Checking* > uncheck *Enable background error checking*.

> Upon checking we can identify which names are duplicated, used a wrong station_id and missing from the official **Stations** table. By sorting the column by **id_status**, we can see that all the station_id in column A has a mixed types of data, *varchar* and *bigint*.

> Some stations names have null values, data are filled after finding same station ID and vice-versa.

<h3 align = "center"><strong>NULL values</strong></h3>

Some data are omitted in table **trips_p2** that has NULL **station_names** & **station_id**. Although these records doesn't contain any data about its *station_names* and *station_IDs*, these have a coordinates which then can be used later on to identify the nearby **DIVVY** station name. The data will be filled in the future after finishing my studies on Webscraping in Python.

*Number of records*
```
| Data     | No. of records |
| -------- | -------------- |
| trips_p1 |     24,426,783 |       
| trips_p2 |      9,136,746 |
| trips    |     33,563,529 |
| NULL     |      1,158,190 |
```

*Percent of NULL values*
```
| Table    | NULL values |
| -------- | ----------- |
| trips_p1 |         0 % |
| trips_p2 |     12.68 % |
| trips    |      3.45 % |
```

Divvy-bikeshare dataset contains 3.45% of NULL values. Since the percentage is small, we can then omit these records and proceed with the analysis.

**SQL Queries**:

*Number of records*
```sql
-- trips_p1: 24,426,783
SELECT COUNT(*) FROM bike_trips.trips_p1;

-- trips_p2: 9,136,746
SELECT COUNT(*) FROM bike_trips.trips_p2;

-- total: 33,563,529
SELECT COUNT(*) FROM bike_trips.trips;

-- total NULL records: 1,158,190
SELECT CAST(COUNT(*) AS numeric) 
  FROM bike_trips.trips_p2
  WHERE (start_station_name IS NULL 
  AND start_station_id IS NULL)
  OR (end_station_name IS NULL
  AND end_station_id IS NULL);
```

*Percent of NULL values*
```sql
-- trips_p1
SELECT round(100 * 
 (SELECT CAST(COUNT(*) AS numeric) 
  FROM bike_trips.trips_p1
  WHERE (start_station_name IS NULL 
  AND start_station_id IS NULL)
  OR (end_station_name IS NULL
  AND end_station_id IS NULL)
  ) /	
 (SELECT CAST(COUNT(*) AS numeric)
  FROM bike_trips.trips_p1)
			 , 2) AS NULL_values_percent

-- none
```

```sql
-- trips_p2
SELECT round(100 * 
 (SELECT CAST(COUNT(*) AS numeric) 
  FROM bike_trips.trips_p2
  WHERE (start_station_name IS NULL 
  AND start_station_id IS NULL)
  OR (end_station_name IS NULL
  AND end_station_id IS NULL)
  ) /	
 (SELECT CAST(COUNT(*) AS numeric)
  FROM bike_trips.trips_p2)
			 , 2) AS NULL_values_percent

-- 12.68% of data is NULL
```

Since only table **trips_p2** has NULL values, we then use the table **trips_p2** as reference.
```sql
-- entire dataset
SELECT round(100 * 
 (SELECT CAST(COUNT(*) AS numeric) 
  FROM bike_trips.trips_p2
  WHERE (start_station_name IS NULL 
  AND start_station_id IS NULL)
  OR (end_station_name IS NULL
  AND end_station_id IS NULL)
  ) /	
 (SELECT CAST(COUNT(*) AS numeric)
  FROM bike_trips.trips)
			 , 2) AS omitted_data_percent

-- 3.45% of data is NULL
```

<h3><strong>Missing stations</strong></h3>

Now that we have the missing stations from the 2 tables, trips_p1 & trips_p2, combine them into one table and save as [missing_stations.csv](https://github.com/56i8/divvy-bikeshare/blob/master/data%20wrangling/csv%20files/stations_cleaning/missing_stations.csv).

*Import csv file*

- missing_stations.csv

Add the missing stations to Stations table

```sql
-- Import
COPY bike_trips.stations (
  id, 
  name, 
  docks,
  in_service, 
  latitude, 
  longitude, 
  coordinate)
FROM 'D:/Github/divvy-bikeshare/csv files/stations/missing_stations.csv'
DELIMITER ',' CSV HEADER;
```


<h3><strong>Cleaning</strong></h3>

Some IDs need to change from the table.

*Import csv file*

- id_changes_stations.csv
```sql
-- Create table
CREATE TABLE bike_trips.id_changes_stations (
  name varchar,
  id bigint);
```
```sql
-- Import
COPY bike_trips.id_changes_stations (name, id)
FROM 'D:/Github/divvy-bikeshare/csv files/stations/id_changes_stations.csv'
DELIMITER ',' CSV HEADER;
```

*ID change*

```sql
UPDATE bike_trips.stations as s
SET id = c.new_id
FROM bike_trips.id_changes_stations as c
WHERE s.name = c.old_name;
```
